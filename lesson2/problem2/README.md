# Problem 2: Metadata Schema Design and Lineage Tracking

## Learning Objectives
- Design comprehensive metadata schemas following DAMA-DMBOK standards
- Implement data lineage tracking systems for impact analysis
- Build automated metadata collection and documentation processes
- Create data dictionaries and business glossaries for enterprise data assets

## Background
As your organization's data ecosystem grows, tracking the flow of data from source to consumption becomes critical for governance, compliance, and operational efficiency. You need to design and implement a metadata management system that captures both technical and business metadata while providing clear data lineage visualization.

## Scenario
Your organization processes data through multiple transformation stages:
1. **Source Systems** → Raw data ingestion
2. **Data Lake** → Staging and preprocessing
3. **Data Warehouse** → Business transformations
4. **Analytics Layer** → Reports and dashboards

Your task is to build a metadata management framework that tracks data movement, transformations, and dependencies across this pipeline.

## Task Requirements

### Part A: Metadata Schema Design (30 points)
Design a comprehensive metadata schema that includes:
- **Technical Metadata**: Table schemas, column properties, data types, constraints
- **Business Metadata**: Business definitions, data stewards, business rules
- **Operational Metadata**: Job schedules, data freshness, processing statistics
- **Quality Metadata**: Data quality rules, validation results, quality scores

### Part B: Data Lineage Implementation (40 points)
Build a lineage tracking system that:
- Maps source-to-target relationships across transformation layers
- Tracks field-level lineage for critical business elements
- Identifies upstream and downstream dependencies
- Supports impact analysis for change management
- Generates lineage graphs and dependency matrices

### Part C: Automated Metadata Collection (30 points)
Implement automated processes for:
- Schema discovery from database systems and files
- Metadata extraction from ETL/transformation scripts
- Business glossary population from documentation
- Metadata validation and quality checks
- Synchronized updates across metadata repositories

## Deliverables
1. `metadata_schema.json` - Complete metadata schema definition
2. `lineage_tracker.py` - Data lineage tracking implementation
3. `metadata_collector.py` - Automated metadata collection system
4. `business_glossary.json` - Business terms and definitions
5. `lineage_graph.html` - Interactive lineage visualization
6. `impact_analysis.py` - Impact analysis tool for change management

## Sample Data Pipeline
You'll work with a realistic data pipeline:

```
Sales_DB.orders → staging.raw_orders → warehouse.fact_sales → dashboard.sales_report
     ↓               ↓                     ↓                    ↓
Customer_API → staging.raw_customers → warehouse.dim_customer → dashboard.customer_analysis
     ↓
Product_Feed → staging.raw_products → warehouse.dim_product
```

## Technical Specifications

### Metadata Schema Structure
```json
{
  "asset_id": "unique_identifier",
  "asset_type": "table|view|file|report",
  "technical_metadata": {
    "schema": {},
    "location": "",
    "format": "",
    "size": 0
  },
  "business_metadata": {
    "owner": "",
    "steward": "",
    "definition": "",
    "business_rules": []
  },
  "lineage": {
    "upstream_assets": [],
    "downstream_assets": [],
    "transformations": []
  }
}
```

### Lineage Tracking Features
- **Field-level lineage**: Track column transformations and derivations
- **Transformation logic**: Capture SQL, Python, or other transformation code
- **Dependency mapping**: Build complete dependency graphs
- **Impact analysis**: Identify affected downstream assets from changes

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Schema Design** (25%): Completeness and adherence to metadata standards
- **Lineage Accuracy** (30%): Correct mapping of data flow and dependencies
- **Automation Quality** (25%): Effectiveness of automated collection processes
- **Usability** (20%): Clarity of documentation and visualization tools

## Getting Started
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source ../../venv/bin/activate

# Install additional packages
pip install networkx matplotlib plotly

# Generate sample pipeline data
python generate_pipeline_data.py

# Run metadata collection
python metadata_collector.py

# Generate lineage visualization
python lineage_tracker.py
```

## Business Context
This exercise simulates real-world metadata management challenges:
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Track data origins for audit requirements
- **Change Impact**: Understand downstream effects of system changes
- **Data Discovery**: Help users find and understand available data
- **Quality Monitoring**: Track data quality across the pipeline

## Advanced Features (Bonus)
- Integration with Apache Atlas or similar metadata management tools
- Real-time lineage updates from streaming data pipelines
- Machine learning for automated business term extraction
- API endpoints for metadata query and updates

## Expected Time
- Part A: 60 minutes
- Part B: 90 minutes
- Part C: 60 minutes
- **Total: 3.5 hours**
